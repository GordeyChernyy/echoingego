# Echoing Ego

## How to run

You will have to run a server to avoid a [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) error. Use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) spin up one quickly. Install:

```
 $ npm install http-server -g
```

Then go to the root of your echoing ego project, and run the server:

```
$ cd echoingego
$ http-server .
```
Now checkout the project at http://localhost:8080/!
